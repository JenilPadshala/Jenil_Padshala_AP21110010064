SELECTION SORT:
    - It selects the minimum value in the array
    - Selection sort takes less number of comparisons than bubble sort

   ## Steps:
        1. First find smallest value from all given values
        2. Then compare it with first value, swap if it is less than first element
        3. Now smallest value is placed at first position.
        4. From the remaining elements find smallest element again and compare with second element
        5. Continue the same process for remaining all elements

INSERTION SORT:
    - Works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands.
    - It is not appropriate for large data sets as the time complexity of insertion sort in 
        the average case and worst case is O(n^2), where n is the number of items.
    - Insertion sort is less efficient that the other sorting algorithms like heap sort, quick 
        sort, merge sort, etc.
    - On average (k + ) / 2 comparisons are required to place the kth element into its correct 
        position. Therefore, average number of comparisons required for 7th element = (7+1)/2=4
    

MERGE SORT:
    - It is a divide and conquer algorithm.
    - Divides given input array into 2 parts until pair is formed, then perform sort and finally combine each pair of sorted values
    - Time complexity is O(nlogn)
    - Space complexity is O(n)


QUICK SORT:
	- It is divide and conquer algorithm.
	- The algorithm was developed by a British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959.
	- Fastest sort algorithm.
	- Quick sort is also called as "PartitionExchange" sort
	- Time complexity is O(nlogn)

		ALGORITHM:
			1. Select first or any element of given array as pivot
            2. Initialize i with 0 index and j with last index
            3. Increment i if arr[i] <= pivot, otherwise stop
            4. Decrement j if arr[j]>pivot, otherwise stop
            5. Now if i<j then swap arr[i] and arr[j]
            6. Repeat steps 3,4 and 5 upto i and j cross each other(i>j).
            7. Finally, swap pivot element with the element pointed by j which is corect place for pivot.
