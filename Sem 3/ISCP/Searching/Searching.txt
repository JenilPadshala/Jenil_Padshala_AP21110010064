Searching:  is the process of identifying whether the element(key) os available or not in the given input values

Linear Search:
    - Linear search is also known as sequential search
    - Time complexity is O(n).
    - It compares each element with key from the zero location of the list
    -Eg.
        Target|15|          Unsorted list |13|48|7|4|15|25|11|
            Comparison 1: 15!=13
            Comparison 2: 15!=48
            Comparison 2: 15!=7
            Comparison 2: 15!=4
            Comparison 2: 15=15
    (Go through each index until element found, then stop.)


Binary Search:
    -It is faster than linear search
    -Input elements must be in sorted order
    -Time complexity is O(logN), where N is number of elements
    -Algorithm:
        *Initialize first element index as low, last element index as high
        *find middle element index mid=(low+high)/2
        *Now compare key with mid
        *If key==mid index value then display element found
        *If key>arr[mid] then low=mid+1
            else if key<arr[mid] then high = mid-1
